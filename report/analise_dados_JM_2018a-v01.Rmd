**Evaluation of monoplex and biplex assays**

In an initial exploratory analysis, the inspection of the residuals in a classical ANOVA showed the assumption of normality was not strongly violated (no significant values were obtained from the Shapiro-Wilk test, results not shown).
The Levene test, however, indicated the assumption of homogeneity of variances was violated in most monoplex samples tested (p = 0.00002 for Measles, p = 0.25029 for Mumps and p = 0.00761 for Rubella).
We therefore opted to use the same procedure of the Welch correction in all analyses performed.
In the same manner, the Games-Howell post-hoc test was employed to correct for multiple comparisons in the presence of heteroskedasticity.

For the biplex samples, the Levene test did not show evidence of heterogeneity of variances for either Measles (p = `r lev.measles.bi.p`), Mumps (p = `r lev.mumps.bi.p`) or Rubella (p = `r lev.rubella.bi.p`).
For simplicity sake these experiments were analyzed with the same methodology as described above.

# Results

## Evaluation of monoplex and biplex assays

As expected, a significant titer change was observed between the three formulations (bulk, final bulk and final batch), with the three vaccine virus strains.
This effect was observed when using both the Monoplex assay
<!-- (p = `r welch.aov.measles.mono.p`, p = `r welch.aov.mumps.mono.p` and p = `r welch.aov.rubella.mono.p` for Measles, Mumps and Rubella, respectively), -->
and the Biplex assay
<!-- (p = `r welch.aov.measles.bi.p`, p = `r welch.aov.mumps.m.bi.p`, p = `r welch.aov.mumps.r.bi.p`,  and p = `r welch.aov.rubella.bi.p` for Measles, Mumps coupled with Measles, Mumps coupled with Rubella and Rubella, respectively). -->
(table 6).
Pairwise post-tests confirm a major titer drop can be consistently detected from the initial bulk formulation the next processing stages in all scenarios evaluated, as described below.
Figure 2 shows the results for the Monoplex assay and Figure 3 shows the mixtures tested in the Biplex assay.

method.
The p-values presented correspond to Welch-ANOVA tests comparing different vaccine formulation stages, per Virus and qPCR mixture.

**Measles**

The Measles sample had significant titer drops from the bulk to both final bulk and final batch formulations
in the monoplex assay
(Games-Howell test, p `r gh.measles.mono.p[1]` and p `r gh.measles.mono.p[2]`, respectively),
and in the biplex assay
(Games-Howell test, p = `r gh.measles.bi.p[1]` and p = `r gh.measles.bi.p[2]`, respectively).
When testing for differences between the final bulk and final batch, we found no significant difference in titers in either the
monoplex (Games-Howell test, p = `r gh.measles.mono.p[3]`) or the
biplex assay (Games-Howell test, p = `r gh.measles.bi.p[3]`).

**Mumps**

The Mumps virus Monoplex assay had significant titer drops from the bulk to both final bulk and final batch formulations
(Games-Howell test, p `r gh.mumps.mono.p[1]` and p `r gh.mumps.mono.p[2]`, respectively).
In both Mumps Biplex mixtures tested, there were significant drops in viral titer from the bulk to other formulations
(Games-Howell test, p = `r gh.mumps.m.bi.p[1]` and p = `r gh.mumps.m.bi.p[2]` for Measles mixture,
and p = `r gh.mumps.r.bi.p[1]` and p = `r gh.mumps.r.bi.p[2]` for Rubella mixture).

There was an average decrease of
`r format.float(abs(gh.mumps.mono$intermediate$posthoc["final batch-final bulk", 1]), 4)`
log10 Copies/PCR in the final batch preparation when compared to the final bulk
(Games-Howell test, p = `r gh.mumps.mono.p[3]`).
Such difference in titer was not observed in the Biplex assay for either
Measles mixture (Games-Howell test, p = `r gh.mumps.m.bi.p[3]`)
or the for
Rubella mixture (Games-Howell test, p = `r gh.mumps.r.bi.p[3]`).

**Rubella**

The Rubella sample had significant titer drops from the bulk to both final bulk and final batch formulations
in the Monoplex assay
(Games-Howell test, p = `r gh.rubella.mono.p[1]` and p = `r gh.rubella.mono.p[2]`, respectively),
and in the Biplex assay
(Games-Howell test, p = `r gh.rubella.bi.p[1]` and p = `r gh.rubella.bi.p[2]`, respectively).
When comparing the two tested vaccine groups (final bulk and final batch), there was no significant difference in either
the monoplex assay, nor in the biplex mixture with Mumps virus
(Games-Howell test, p = `r gh.rubella.mono.p[3]` and  p = `r gh.rubella.bi.p[3]`, respectively).
