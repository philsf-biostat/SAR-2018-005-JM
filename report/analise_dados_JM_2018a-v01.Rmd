# Methods

**Monoplex evaluation**

In an initial exploratory analysis, the inspection of the residuals in a classical ANOVA showed the assumption of normality was not strongly violated (no significant values were obtained from the Shapiro-Wilk test, results not shown).
The Levene test, however, indicated the assumption of homogeneity of variances was violated in most cases (p = 0.00002 for Measles, p = 0.25029 for Mumps and p = 0.00761 for Rubella).
We therefore opted to use the same procedure of the Welch correction in all analyses performed.
In the same manner, the Games-Howell post-hoc test was employed to correct for multiple comparisons in the presence of heteroskedasticity.

**Biplex evaluation**

For the biplex samples, the Levene test did now show evidence of homogeneity of variances for either Measles (p = `r lev.measles.bi.p`), Mumps (p = `r lev.mumps.bi.p`) or Rubella (p = `r lev.rubella.bi.p`).
For simplicity sake these data were analyzed with the same methodology as the monoplex samples (Welch ANOVA and Games-Howell post-test).

## Monoplex evaluation

![**Figure 2**: Comparison of viral titer by monoplex qPCR in the different vaccine formulations.](../figures/monoplex.png)

**Measles**

There were significant differences between the vaccine groups considered (Welch ANOVA, p < 0.00001).
We observed an average decrease of 2.0745 copies/PCR (log10) in final vaccine bulk, when compared to the bulk vaccine (Games-Howell test, p < 0.00001), and an average decrease of 1.8423 copies/PCR (log10) in final vaccine batch, when compared to the bulk vaccine (Games-Howell test, p < 0.00001).
When comparing the two tested vaccine groups (final bulk and final batch), there was no significant difference (Games-Howell test, p = 0.09923).

**Mumps**

There were significant differences between the vaccine groups considered (Welch ANOVA, p < 0.00001).
We observed an average decrease of 1.2904 copies/PCR (log10) in final vaccine bulk, when compared to the bulk vaccine (Games-Howell test, p < 0.00001), and an average decrease of 1.4848 copies/PCR (log10) in final vaccine batch, when compared to the bulk vaccine (Games-Howell test, p < 0.00001).
When comparing the two tested vaccine groups, there is also a significant difference (Games-Howell test, p = 0.02198), indicating an average decrease of 0.1945 Copies/PCR (in log10) in the final batch preparation compared to the final bulk preparation.

**Rubella**

There were significant differences between the vaccine groups considered (Welch ANOVA, p = 0.00003).
We observed an average decrease of 1.3083 copies/PCR (log10) in final vaccine bulk, when compared to the bulk vaccine (Games-Howell test, p = 0.00002), and an average decrease of 1.0209 copies/PCR (log10) in final vaccine batch, when compared to the bulk vaccine (Games-Howell test, p = 0.00035).
When comparing the two tested vaccine groups (final bulk and final batch), there was no significant difference (Games-Howell test, p = 0.06272).

## Biplex evaluation

![**Figure 3**: Comparison of viral titer by biplex qPCR mixtures in the different vaccine formulations.](../figures/biplex.png)

As expected a major drop was observed with the three vaccine virus strains, between the three formulations (p = `r welch.aov.measles.bi.p`, p = `r welch.aov.measles.bi.p` and p = `r welch.aov.rubella.bi.p` for Measles, Mumps and Rubella, respectively).

**Measles**

The Measles sample had significant titer drops from the bulk to both final bulk and final batch formulations (Games-Howell test p = `r gh.measles.bi.p[1]` and p = `r gh.measles.bi.p[2]`, respectively).
When testing for differences final bulk and final batch, we found no significant difference in titers (p = `r gh.measles.bi.p[3]`).

**Mumps**

**Rubella**
