## Measles

The Welch ANOVA indicates the difference between groups (p < 0.00001), where there is a significant decrease in the log quantity (measured in copies/PCR) in both vaccine preparations considered (final vaccine bulk, and final vaccine batch), when compared to the bulk vaccine (in both cases, the Games-Howell test returns p < 0.00001).
When comparing the two tested vaccine groups, there is no significant difference (Games-Howell test, p = 0.09923).

## Mumps

The Welch ANOVA indicates the difference between groups (p < 0.00001), where there is a significant decrease in the log quantity (measured in copies/PCR) in both vaccine preparations considered (final vaccine bulk, and final vaccine batch), when compared to the bulk vaccine (in both cases, the Games-Howell test return p < 0.00001).
When comparing the two tested vaccine groups, there is also a significant difference (Games-Howell test, p = 0.02198), indicating an average decrease of 0.19 Copies/PCR (in log10) in the final batch preparation compared to the final bulk preparation.

## Rubella

The Welch ANOVA indicates the difference between groups (p = 0.00003), where there is a significant decrease in the log quantity (measured in copies/PCR) in both vaccine preparations considered.
The final vaccine bulk shows a significant decrease respective to the bulk vaccine (Games-Howell test, p = 0.00002), as well as the final vaccine batch (Games Howell test, p = 0.00035).
When comparing the two tested vaccine groups, there is no significant difference (Games-Howell test, p = 0.06272).
